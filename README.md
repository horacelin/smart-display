smart-display
=============
An Android Hybrid App for user to upoad photos or videos and to auto display full-screen slideshow, offline display available by using the PouchDB as the database. The original idea was to use the localstorage for photos and video files, however, due to the size limitation, I had switched the storage to couchDB-based PouchDB.
<ul>
<li>AngularJS 1.29
<li>jQuery 1.9.1 (only to support jquery.flexslider.js for slideshow)
<li>Bootstrap 3.0
<li>PouchDB 1.1.0 (for offline images videos storage)
<li>PhoneGap 3.0 (Cordova)
</ul>
